AMPlifier v2.35 is recommended as it requires relatively light resources

To use dsp3210mpeg.device in AMPlifier:

- Save dsp3210mpeg.device in DEVS:
- In AMPlifier, under the menu option Settings/Configuration, in the Audio I/O tab, select MPEG audio player and Configure.  
- In the Decoder tab set layer I and II and layer III to Hardware and choose MPEG Device to be devs:dsp3210mpeg.device and unit 0
- Set the buffers as high as you can spare for your system

dsp3210mpeg.device supports an environment variable DSP3210MPEG, which currently has the following switches:

L2MONO - if set, this forces mono output on layer II files
QUAL   - if set, this sets the frequency divisor to 2 (default is 4)

Example: setenv DSP3210MPEG QUAL would set the frequency divisor to 2

Currently setting the frequency divisor to 2 and playing an MP3 is unsupported, and will crash your Amiga
